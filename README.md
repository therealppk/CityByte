## Introduction
New and improved! Add more description here...

Below are the new features and improvements we made:
1. Implemented a wish list/to-go list to save interesting locations so you can come back and look at them later
2. Implement Caching to get API results faster
3. Created a signup/login page - having an account goes a long way when we add new features that are customized for the user!
4. Comment Page - you can comment on the place and look at all the other comments that have been posted!
5. Fixed WeatherApi Bug

## Introduction
Moving to a new location can be a daunting endeavor, especially when you have the entire world to choose from. Finding a new home from scratch while prioritizing certain aspects might be very challenging given the variety of nations and cities. However, with the advancement of technology, information from earlier times can now be leveraged to offer a number of vital insights about a certain location. Our project succeeds in one of those objectives. We seek to present that information in our project because there are many other elements that are taken into consideration when choosing a place to reside, such as weather, temperature, entertainment options, landmark locations, education, and many more. The project is totally created using a variety of technologies, including some of the accessible APIs that are utilized to fetch real-time data.

Although this project is still in its early phases of development, it can be expanded up even further by including multiple features that can benefit society in a variety of different ways. This article offers a critical viewpoint that users can use to comprehend the project, adopt it as open source software, and add further features before releasing it to the market. The document also serves as a starting point for the project and helps developers understand the code.

The technologies listed below were used to build the entire project, and it is advised that the group of developers who take on this project in the future retain these tools on hand:

* Python3
* Django
* Pytest
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* BootStrap

Although we have used HTML, CSS and Bootstrap for the frontend logic the user can use any technologies and combine it with backend such as Angular, React etc.

## Result
